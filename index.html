    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <img src="picture.jpg" alt="My test image">
    <p>Hello! My name is Jai Gokhale:</p>

  
    <p>I am very excited about attending the Digital Crafts Immersive bootcamp. In particular, the opportunity to learn meaningful technologies relevant to todayâ€™s job market.

      <br><br> My background as a petroleum engineer has allowed me to work on diverse projects across the United States, working with different teams and in unique environments. I hold both a bachelor's and master's degree in petroleum engineering from Penn State. I am seeking to expand on my coding experience, learn new technologies and successfully deploy them to achieve a career transition as a full stack developer.
      
      <br><br>My hobbies include spending time with my family, traveling and fishing. Having spent considerable time in Dubai, U.A.E. I have had the opportunity to visit some incredible travel destinations including Europe and Far East Asia. 
      
      <br><br>Thanks for reading a little bit about me, I look forward to learning more about my peers and working cohesively toward the completion of our course. All the best!      
        </p>
